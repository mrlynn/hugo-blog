      <description>MongoDB Stitch is a power tool in your toolbox, capable of integrating your databases to any service with a publically available API. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a number of articles on this on MongoDB&amp;rsquo;s Blog but in this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll share a quick lesson on how to integrate data from Google Sheets, Google&amp;rsquo;s online spreadsheet, into MongoDB using MongoDB Stitch. Watch the video or read on to learn what&amp;rsquo;s involved.
Starting the Workflow There are two key elements that make this solution work.</description>

      <title>Getting started with MongoDB Atlas</title>

      <description>Launching an M0 - Free Tier Instance MongoDB Atlas is a database as a service offering from MongoDB. Getting started is super simple and takes only about 10 minutes. Atlas offers various tiered service levels started with m0 and continuing with larger amounts of resource (cpu, disk, etc.) on up to m400 that comes with 488GB of RAM and 3TB of storage by default.
  Obviously, the larger the instance size, the more you&amp;rsquo;ll spend per hour but the good news is that you can pause these clusters when they&amp;rsquo;re not needed.</description>

      <description>I had the pleasure of speaking at CodeCamp NYC on Saturday, October 20th. Attached is the presentation I shared.
  Serverless Application Development with MongoDB Stitch  from Michael Lynn  The talk covered a basic introduction to [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com), how it differs from Tabular Database Management Systems like [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx), [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com), and the like. I also introduced [MongoDB Atlas](http://cloud.mongodb.com), the Database as a Service and [MongoDB Stitch](http://docs.mongodb.com/stitch), the Backend as a Service.</description>

      <title>Sizing MongoDB: Knowing the Unknowable</title>

      <description>How many servers do I need? How many CPU&amp;rsquo;s, how much memory? How fast should the storage be? Do I need to I shard? As part of my job as a Solutions Architect, I&amp;rsquo;m asked to help provide guidance and recommendations for sizing infrastructure that will run MongoDB databases. In nearly every case, I feel like Nostradamus. That is to say, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m being asked to predict the future.</description>

      <title>Serverless Functions in MongoDB Stitch</title>

      <description>Serverless and Functions as a Service are relatively new development paradigms that are gaining in popularity. Let’s take a quick look at what MongoDB Stitch offers in this space.

Functions in Stitch are written in JavaScript ECMAScript and can be called from others scripts in Stitch, or from external JavaScript leveraging the client SDK.
Here’s an example of a function in Stitch:
exports = function(message) { const mongodb = context.</description>

      <title>Creating a Data Enabled API in 10 Minutes with MongoDB Stitch</title>

      <description>Introduction Creating an API that exposes data doesn’t have to be complicated. With MongoDB Stitch, you can create a data enabled endpoint in about 10 minutes or less. At the heart of the entire process is MongoDB Stitch’s Services. There are several from which to choose and to create a data enabled endpoint, you’ll choose the HTTP Service with a Webhook.
When you create an HTTP Service, you’re enabling access to this service from Stitch’s serverless functions in the form of an object called context.</description>

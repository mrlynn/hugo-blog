I had the pleasure of attending this year's Developer Relations Conference organized and run by Evans Data Research. Below are notes I captured from the event. Let me start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed the conference. It's never easy to justify attending a conference â€” especially one that requires some cross-country travel.

**tl; dr** Developer Relations requires a deep understanding of the desires, behaviors and motivations developers. This conference achieved three main things for me: 1) It enabled me to learn more about developers so that I can better serve them and help to improve their lives with the tools available to me. Next, I learned how others in my field are succeeding and failing at doing the same.  Lastly, I learned that  putting brand, and product behind the needs, and desires of the developer opens up an entirely new set of possibilities.

I'm new to DevRel - but aren't we all?  The more time I spend in DevRel, the more I come to understand that my role is really about improving the lives of developers.  I do this through the exchange of information. The nature of the information depends largely upon the specifics of the developer with whom I'm relating.

More important than anything else that I learned at this conference is that data is (are?) key.

### Different Paths

I suppose there are dozens of paths to Developer Relations and mine is not dramatically unlike many, I'm sure. I started my career as a systems programmer and bounced between administration, engineering, architecture and finally landed in Pre-sales at a series of software companies. This is a role that overlaps a great deal with Developer Relations.

I loved Pre-sales software engineering, architecture, consulting. It appeals to anyone with deep technical and development skills that also has a strong desire to communicate socially.

So when the opportunity to move into Developer Relations full time, there wasn't much of a question. I accepted the position of Global Director of Developer Relations at MongoDB and I embarked on my career in DevRel.

That decision was one year ago and while it's not always been easy, I've loved the journey and I've loved getting to know MongoDB as a company and the developer community through the lens of this fascinating mix of developer, advocate, social media, speaker, presenter, leader, marketer and communicator.

### It's not failure

Developer Relations, Advocacy is different than anything I've done before. While many of the tasks look and feel the same: Writing code to solve problems; Teaching, enabling and helping developers in the community;

It's hard.

Developer Advocates do more.

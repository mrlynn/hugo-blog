With 2018 coming to a close and a new year almost upon us, I find myself reflecting, and planning. I find myself constantly asking myself, how can I improve?  How can I become more efficient? and what will I do differently next year? Out of this self-analytical pondering, I've started to create lists and one of them is activities for my day. I start with the past, move to the current and that will enable me to plan for next year.

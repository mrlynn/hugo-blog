As MongoDB's Global Head of Developer Advocacy, I knew I'd have a tough job when I took it last year. I had read all of the negative reviews, the real-world problems with earlier versions and the more recent security leaks from insecure deployments of older MongoDB implementations. Having worked with the product, first hand, I am aware that there were real issues that required fixing. B ut I can honestly tell you that the engineers and people responsible for deciding which issues get addressed and in what order are genuinely good, smart, rational people. Decisions about which features to enable and in what order don't go easy - these decisions are made with great deliberation.

First, I should tell you about the motivations of the initial development of the product. Eliot has talked about his motivations openly from the beginning. He set out to create a database that was easy to use so that developers could concentrate on writing code and not have to worry about the database. This, as I have learned is a consistent thread woven into the fabric of every single decision about what bug to fix, and what feature to enable.

The fact that some people using MongoDB would have preferred to have multi-master, or a simpler configuration workflow is difficult but at the end of the day, you can serve one master well. And that, is exactly what Eliot has done... the master he's served, you ask? Well that's easy - the developer workflow.

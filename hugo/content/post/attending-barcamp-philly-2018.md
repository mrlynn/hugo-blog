### Jess Mason - What are you nerdy about?

I loved this session.  The host started the session by pairing attendees and asking them to learn about each other.  He didn't share anything at the start - or define what nerdy is...

How would you know that someone is passionate about - or nerds out about a specific thing just by looking at them?

### Loren Ripley - 2018 ELECTIONS: WHAT HAPPENED & THE WAY FORWARD

The largest wave since Richard Nixon. An overwhelmingly democratic vote.  We did exceptionally well.

89 vs. 82 . in 2016 82% voted for Hilary (D), this election 89% voted to retain our democratic Governor.

367 - Democrats gained 367 seats in state legislatures around the country.

22-12, 19-17

22 state govern where r controlled the assembly, senate and gov office... now it's 19-17

When you have government where one party in control... things get bad.

Colorado, Michigan - Voting populations voted for redistricting.

Loren shared a number of statistics and topics and a lot of these I didn't follow, but I enjoyed the overall tone and sentiment of the session. Loren's an incredibly well informed voter. I would recommend that Loren put his thoughts into deck.  He wrote some stats on the board and spoke to those - but I found it difficult to follow.

Energy - money is still talking.

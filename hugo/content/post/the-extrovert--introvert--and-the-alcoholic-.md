## The Extrovert

Being a Developer Advocate has to be one of the most exciting and rewarding careers I can imagine. It provides the perfect blend of the deeply technical, and the highly artistic, and communicative. One day I’m developing an application demonstrating MongoDB and then next, presenting on stage at a conference talking about how that app works. I love this blend and I can’t at this moment imagine doing anything else with such passion. Many people that do what I do are found to be naturally gregarious: they’re natural on stage and in front of crowds.

## The Introvert

I have a confession to make, however. I’m not always entirely comfortable in the more social aspects of this role. You might find this odd, and even doubt the validity of this claim when you look at my schedule, and my past accomplishments — that’s ok… I get it. Outwardly, I don’t appear to be an introvert.

Happily, I’m a functioning introvert and I’ve learned and refined a set of skills that enable me to become quite comfortable and quite successful in any situation.

## The Alcoholic

If you’re like me, you’ve been at events where this condition wreaks havoc on your ability to socialize. For me, social events are a challenge. The mere act of typing that takes some of its power. In many instances in the past, I would turn to alcohol as a calming agent. It quieted the nerves, it eased the pain of my awkwardness and enabled me to feel more comfortable coming out of my shell.

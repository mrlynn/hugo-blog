Perhaps that analogy is a stretch. But, really, when you think of it aren't they? Aren't Charts the feathers upon which your data flies to its most beautiful utility?

Until recently, if you wanted to visualize your MongoDB Data, you had a relatively limited set of options: You could export your data, and import it into some RDBMS and then connect to and use a Business Intelligence tool such as Tableau, Looker, Qlik or similar; You could leverage the BI-Connector tool from MongoDB to expose your data to one of these legacy BI tools; And, lastly, you could build your own charts and visualizations using charting libraries and SDK's.

[MongoDB Charts](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/charts) is the fastest and easiest way to create visualizations of data you have in MongoDB.

No, this article is not about an embarrassing personal hygiene issue or something you get from contact with a semi poisonous plant. Developer's Itch is something you may experience as a developer who's not currently in a full-time engineer role.

If you're a full-time developer, engineer, programmer, data scientist/analyst, or you do something related to these for a living â€” congratulations! For those of us on the cusp or not fully immersed in an engineer role, we have to find ways, or carve out time to satisfy the desire to build, create, engineer, develop, program or whichever verb best describes the thing you do to scratch that itch.

Perhaps, you've started on a leadership path, or have transitioned to a hybrid role - something like Developer Relations, Product Management or similar.

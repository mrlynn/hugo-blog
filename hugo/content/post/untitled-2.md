### To drink, or not to drink

For many, the decision to drink or not drink has about as much or as little significance as choosing which shirt to wear. For these people, this decision requires little thought or effort and the outcome is relatively inconsequential: they drink, they stop, or they don't drink at all. For others, however, deciding to drink or not drink is painful and in some cases, a foregone conclusion with massively negative consequences. They appear to have lost the power of choice in the matter. They seem stuck in an endless, groundhog day-like cycle of drinking to excess, remorsefully recovering, not drinking, then starting all over again.

On the rare occasion when I was able to say no... and not drink, there was little enjoyment to be had. Toward the end of my drinking, I was miserable if I was unable to drink the way I wanted to drink. I focused on the drinking of others. How much were they drinking, or not drinking? When would I be able to drink again?

### Why can't I just drink like other people?

If you've read this far, perhaps you're just intrigued by my story. Or, maybe you're wrestling with some of the same questions I continually asked myself:

* _Why can't I just drink like other people_
* _Why can't I stop after a couple?_
* _How did I end up in this situation again?_

If you're asking yourself these questions regularly, you may suffer from the same condition as me. I learned that no matter how I tried, I could never quite pull off drinking like I saw others drinking.

This frustrating lack of control led me to a seemingly endless series of experiments. I tried drinking only on weekends, drinking only beer, drinking only wine, not drinking alone, just drinking at home, not drinking. Nothing I did gave me the ability to drink like an average person. Once I took that first drink, any sense of control disappeared entirely leaving me baffled, embarrassed and defeated.

### The scientific answer

I'm no scientist or expert, but I have learned a great deal about variations in how the human body metabolizes alcohol.

{{< figure src="/content/images/2019/01/metabolic.gif" caption="Metabolism of Alcohol" >}}

An average normal drinker consumes alcohol, and the body breaks it down from Alcohol (ethanol) to Acetaldehyde to Acetate and then it's broken down completely. To drink successfully and maintain that euphoric feeling, a normal drinker can consume and metabolize about one ounce of alcohol per hour. At this rate, the average body can keep up, and the adverse effects are minimized.  The chemical decomposition of ethanol through the alcoholic’s body follows the same process as a normal drinker until it reaches the "acetate" stage.  At that point, the liver and pancreas of the alcoholic fail to produce the necessary enzymes to complete the decomposition process. As a result, acetate remains in the body. Coincidentally, acetate produces the "craving" that deprives the alcoholic of the ability to control the amount they drink.

There are [lengthy medical articles](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa72/aa72.htm) that will do a better job of explaining this than I'm able but suffice to say that there is medical, and scientific proof that alcohol is metabolized differently in those people demonstrating an inability to drink successfully. The alcoholic is bodily different than normal drinkers.

### Physical, and mental

Spend enough time with alcoholics, and you will undoubtedly hear stories from that go something like this:

> I was fine. I had stopped. Then, out of the blue, the thought of a drink popped into my head, and I found myself drunk, once again.

This is what recovering alcoholics refer to as the _curious mental twist_. If alcohol doesn't enter the body, it (Ethanol, then Acetaldehyde, then Acetate) can't trigger a craving, right?

Right.

However, in the mind of the alcoholic, when they're able to avoid alcohol altogether, they begin to obsess — intensely focusing on a drink so that it becomes so big that there's no choice but to, once again, drink starting the cycle all over again.

This is when the disease of alcoholism goes from a physical craving caused by acetate to a mental obsession, the cause of which I do not understand.

### Alcoholism is a disease

I've come to learn that alcoholism is in fact, a disease. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) describes Alcoholism as Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD.)

To be diagnosed with AUD, individuals  meeting any two of the 11 criteria during the same 12-month period receives a diagnosis of AUD. The severity of AUD—mild, moderate, or severe—is based on the number of criteria met.

Think you might have this... or know somebody that does? [As yourself or them these eleven questions to get an idea.](https://blog.mlynn.org/eleven-signs-you-have-a-drinking-problem/)

### Progressive and Deadly

For years, starting as an occasional drinker in my teens, I enjoyed my drinking. I was able to drink successfully at parties, events and even casual gatherings. Apart from a DUI in my early twenties, I didn't experience major negative consequences until my late twenties and into my thirties.

It wasn't until then, that I realized how difficult it can actually be to stop altogether. As it turns out, there is scientific evidence of the progressive nature of alcoholism and its effects.

> _Scientists believe that a gradual and, perhaps, permanent adaptation of brain function (i.e., neuroadaptation) to the presence of alcohol is a central feature in the development of alcohol dependence (Robinson and Berridge 1993; Koob and Le Moal 1997). ... many cells—including nerve cells (i.e., neurons) in the brain—adapt their activities in response to the prolonged presence of alcohol. This neuroadaptation, or sensitization, leads to certain characteristics of alcohol dependence, such as tolerance and withdrawal, as well as to a condition that might be called reward memory ([see figure 1, p. 168](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad05/76679357fe6d156fc1f725be0044854f6009.pdf)), a memory that has its roots in certain brain cells and is dependent on chemical changes in those cells._

Alcohol either kills or helps to kill an estimated [2.8 Million people globally each year](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/news/20180823/alcohol-helps-kill-28-million-globally-each-year#1). Among working-age adults, 9.8% of all deaths in the United States during the period from 2001 to  period were attributable to excessive drinking.

### So what's the solution?

For me, the problem was more powerful than any solution I could come up with on my own. I simply didn't have the power necessary to solve this on my own. I sought help and fortunately found a solution in complete abstinence coupled with a program that I will not discuss publicly. I am happy to speak with you directly if you want more information on the specifics of my recovery — of what worked for me. I will however, share some of the things that I've learned over the past five years that have been massively helpful.

### One ['day','minute','mile','problem', 'step','etc.'] at a time

When I look at doing ANYTHING for a lifetime, it seems overwhelming. However, when I look at doing that same thing for a few hours or even a few minutes all of a sudden it becomes not only possible but highly likely. I've used this same concept to manage my drinking. I don't quit for a lifetime; I don't say I'll never ever drink again; I do say that I'm not drinking just for today. That's much more manageable and it not only applies to my drinking — it applies to literally anything I want to do, or not do.

If you're struggling with drinking, just don't drink today... tomorrow will still arrive but don't deal with that right now... just deal with today in fact right now.

In closing, I want to thank the people that have helped me get and stay sober one day at a time for the past five years.

Lastly, I don't want to make it sound like I'm a spokesperson for sobriety. I don't have any special magic solution and I'm no smarter or more sober than anybody else. I've simply discovered a way of life that has dramatically improved my life and the lives of those close to me.
